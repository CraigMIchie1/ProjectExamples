# Project Examples


This Repository exists to hold project examples I am proud of and I think are good demonstrations of my coding skills and abilities.

The projects will consist of highlighting technical skills and passionate projects that I believe will portray the technical skills
required for a data scientist as that is my focus going forward professionally. 

Starters is my Lorenz Butterfly Project:
    - This was a project asked for my Computational Numerical Methods course through my MSc degree in the first semester.
    - Where I wanted to create ML models that could predict the lorenz butterfly effect
    - Lorenz Butterfly effect is a nifty coding project that portrays chaos theory 
    - I developed ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) and RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) models to predict the lorenz butterfly effect

This project was to act as introduction, learn and practice Deep Learning methods and their implementation to different use case
